# Trail_Image_Classification
These are our attempts at automating the classification of trail users around 
the gunnison valley. 
 
In the 1st attempt folder you will find our first crack at classifying trail users.
This was mostly following a tutorial, and overall does not work very well

The Object_Detection folder is where our best attempt is stored.

image labeler has a GUI to label the images quickly and easily. It is now outdated to the
new method of labeling to xml files. 

learningOpenCV is exactly as it says. Mostly for our reference
